### Learning Activities & Resources

**Theory:** My hypothesis was that a blend of LinkedIn Learning videos, YouTube tutorials, and WordPress documentation would offer a holistic understanding of creating child themes for WordPress.

**Test:** I dedicated approximately 8 hours to engage with the identified resources for learning about WordPress child themes. The specific activities included:

1. **LinkedIn Learning Videos:**
   - [WordPress Building Child Themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-child-themes-3/what-you-need-to-know?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545)
   - [Learning Responsive Web Design in the Browser](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-responsive-web-design-in-the-browser/design-responsive-wordpress-themes-in-the-browser?autoplay=true&u=2223545)

2. **YouTube Tutorials:** Explored tutorials focused on setting up WordPress child themes.

3. **WordPress Documentation:**
   - [WordPress Child Themes Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/)
   - [Creating a Child Theme in WordPress](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/wordpress-create-child-theme)

### Content Insights

The learning experiment yielded valuable insights into the creation of child themes for WordPress. Key takeaways include:

- **Functionality of Child Themes:** Child themes empower users to modify existing themes without altering the main theme, ensuring customization without permanent changes to the original design.
  
- **Preservation of Edits:** Changes made to the original theme might be overwritten and lost during updates, but child themes enable edits to be saved separately, remaining unaffected by theme updates.

- **Efficiency in Styling:** Child themes offer efficiency in styling, allowing designers to make changes without the concern of them being removed or altered.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Although the exploration of child themes may not align directly with my career goals, it provided insights into the challenges and considerations of back-end developers. The ability to make efficient styling changes without jeopardizing the entire template is a valuable skill for website designers. While I may not anticipate direct application in my career path, understanding these concepts broadens my knowledge of web development and the diverse tools and techniques employed in the field.

### SMART Goal Integration

In moving forward, I'll apply the SMART goal framework to enhance my learning and ensure its practical application:

- **Specific:** My goal is to enhance and finalize my ArtistryNest startup website, focusing on creating a child theme, incorporating PHP, and leveraging CMS technologies. The website's theme revolves around offering graphic design services such as original illustrations, photo post-processing, poster design, and logo creation.

- **Measurable:** I aim to complete the child theme setup, PHP integration, and CMS technology implementation within the next four weeks, dedicating at least 15 hours weekly to actively work on the project.

- **Achievable:** With the foundational knowledge gained from learning activities and my existing proficiency in web development, I believe this goal is achievable.

- **Relevant:** The project aligns with my broader interest in web development and serves as a practical application of the learned WordPress child theme concepts.

- **Time-Bound:** I will present the finalized ArtistryNest website during the startup showcase event scheduled in five weeks, providing a clear deadline for my goal.

This SMART goal will not only serve as a practical application of the learned concepts but also propel my ArtistryNest project towards fruition, combining creativity with technical expertise.
